By the year 2071, humanity has expanded across the galaxy, filling the surface of other planets with settlements like those on Earth.

Beneath his goofy and aloof demeanor, Spike is haunted by the weight of his violent past. Meanwhile, Jet manages his own troubled memories while taking care of Spike and the Bebop, their ship. The duo is joined by the beautiful con artist Faye Valentine, odd child Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV, and Ein, a bioengineered Welsh corgi.\n\nWhile developing bonds and working to catch a colorful cast of criminals, the Bebop crew's lives are disrupted by a menace from Spike's past. As a rival's maniacal plot continues to unravel, Spike must choose between life with his newfound family or revenge for his old wounds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "When Cowboy Bebop first aired in spring of 1998 on TV Tokyo, only episodes 2-3, 7-15, and 18 were broadcast, it was concluded with a recap special known as Yose Atsume Blues. This was due to anime censorship having increased following the big controversies over Evangelion, as a result most of the series was pulled from the air due to violent content. Satellite channel WOWOW picked up the series in the fall of that year and aired it in its entirety uncensored. Cowboy Bebop was not a ratings hit in Japan, but sold over 19,000 DVD units in the initial release run, and 81,000 overall. Protagonist Spike Spiegel won Best Male Character, and Megumi Hayashibara won Best Voice Actor for her role as Faye Valentine in the 1999 and 2000 Anime Grand Prix, respectively. Cowboy Bebop's biggest influence has been in the United States, where it premiered on Adult Swim in 2001 with many reruns since. The show's heavy Western influence struck a chord with American viewers, where it became a \"gateway drug\" to anime aimed at adult audiences.", "season": "spring", "year": 1998, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "01:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 01:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Visual", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}, {"mal_id": 123, "type": "anime", "name": "Victor Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/123/Victor_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 1506, "type": "anime", "name": "Audio Planning U", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1506/Audio_Planning_U"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Sunrise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 46, "type": "anime", "name": "Award Winning", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}, {"mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "Space", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 5, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/5/Cowboy_Bebop__Tengoku_no_Tobira", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1439/93480.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1439/93480t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1439/93480l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1439/93480.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1439/93480t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1439/93480l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Cowboy Bebop: Tengoku no Tobira"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30ab\u30a6\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30d3\u30d0\u30c3\u30d7 \u5929\u56fd\u306e\u6249"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Cowboy Bebop: The Movie"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Cowboy Bebop: Der Film"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Cowboy Bebop: La Pel\u00edcula"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Cowboy Bebop: Le Film"}], "title": "Cowboy Bebop: Tengoku no Tobira", "title_english": "Cowboy Bebop: The Movie", "title_japanese": "\u30ab\u30a6\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30d3\u30d0\u30c3\u30d7 \u5929\u56fd\u306e\u6249", "title_synonyms": ["Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door"], "type": "Movie", "source": "Original", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2001-09-01T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 1, "month": 9, "year": 2001}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Sep 1, 2001"}, "duration": "1 hr 55 min", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 8.38, "scored_by": 227502, "rank": 228, "popularity": 648, "members": 402384, "favorites": 1742, "synopsis": "Another day, another bounty\u2014such is the life of the often unlucky crew of the Bebop.

However, before he takes his mother's place as Master Chef, he continues to travel China in order to learn more of the many ways of cooking, in the hopes of becoming a legendary chef, just like his mother. During his journey, he meets great friends and fierce rivals who wish to challenge him in the field of cooking.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 1997, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "19:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 19:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Nippon Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/22/Nippon_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 47, "type": "anime", "name": "Gourmet", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/47/Gourmet"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 111, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/111/Corrector_Yui", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1696/105659.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1696/105659t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1696/105659l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1696/105659.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1696/105659t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1696/105659l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Corrector Yui"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Collector Yui"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30e6\u30a4"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Corrector Yui"}], "title": "Corrector Yui", "title_english": "Corrector Yui", "title_japanese": "\u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30e6\u30a4", "title_synonyms": ["Collector Yui"], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 52, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "1999-04-09T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2000-10-20T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 9, "month": 4, "year": 1999}, "to": {"day": 20, "month": 10, "year": 2000}}, "string": "Apr 9, 1999 to Oct 20, 2000"}, "duration": "25 min per ep", "rating": "G - All Ages", "score": 6.86, "scored_by": 7725, "rank": 5199, "popularity": 5465, "members": 18745, "favorites": 67, "synopsis": "Yui is an average schoolgirl who lives in a future where all computers are supported by a single global network known as COMNET.

Will Kimura's overwhelming drive to prove his strength as a boxer overcome Mashiba's desperate wish to provide a better life for Kumi?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Discotek Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 11, "type": "anime", "name": "Madhouse", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 54, "type": "anime", "name": "Combat Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/54/Combat_Sports"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 266, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/266/Gunparade_March__Arata_Naru_Kougunka", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75520.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75520t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75520l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75520.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75520t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75520l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "SOnI9g_LDFc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOnI9g_LDFc", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/SOnI9g_LDFc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/SOnI9g_LDFc/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/SOnI9g_LDFc/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/SOnI9g_LDFc/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/SOnI9g_LDFc/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/SOnI9g_LDFc/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Gunparade March: Arata Naru Kougunka"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30ac\u30f3\u30d1\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u30fb\u30de\u30fc\u30c1 -\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u308b\u884c\u8ecd\u6b4c-"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Gunparade March: A New Song for the March"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Gunparade March"}], "title": "Gunparade March: Arata Naru Kougunka", "title_english": "Gunparade March: A New Song for the March", "title_japanese": "\u30ac\u30f3\u30d1\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u30fb\u30de\u30fc\u30c1 -\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u308b\u884c\u8ecd\u6b4c-", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Game", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2003-02-06T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2003-04-24T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 6, "month": 2, "year": 2003}, "to": {"day": 24, "month": 4, "year": 2003}}, "string": "Feb 6, 2003 to Apr 24, 2003"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.69, "scored_by": 6677, "rank": 6134, "popularity": 5512, "members": 18272, "favorites": 25, "synopsis": "It began in 1945, at the end of the Pacific War.

However, rather than kill him, Dokuro wants to take a different approach. She resolves to be a constant nuisance to Sakura, in an attempt to prevent him from focusing on anything long enough to create his criminal technology. \n\nWith Dokuro going against orders, the angel Sabato is sent out to complete Dokuro's mission. Between the impulsive Dokuro\u2014who often murders Sakura with her bat before reviving him with the magic words \"Pipiru piru piru pipiru pi\"\u2014and the electric baton-wielding Sabato, Sakura's life will never be peaceful again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 777, "type": "anime", "name": "Showgate", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/777/Showgate"}, {"mal_id": 2956, "type": "anime", "name": "Geneon Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2956/Geneon_Entertainment"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 250, "type": "anime", "name": "Media Blasters", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"}, {"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Discotek Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 34, "type": "anime", "name": "HAL Film Maker", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/34/HAL_Film_Maker"}, {"mal_id": 70, "type": "anime", "name": "Nomad", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/70/Nomad"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}, {"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 57, "type": "anime", "name": "Gag Humor", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/57/Gag_Humor"}, {"mal_id": 58, "type": "anime", "name": "Gore", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 358, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/358/Iriya_no_Sora_UFO_no_Natsu", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1108/94990.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1108/94990t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1108/94990l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1108/94990.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1108/94990t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1108/94990l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "mOruWx1ZAeQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOruWx1ZAeQ", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/mOruWx1ZAeQ?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/mOruWx1ZAeQ/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/mOruWx1ZAeQ/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/mOruWx1ZAeQ/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/mOruWx1ZAeQ/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/mOruWx1ZAeQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Iriya no Sora, UFO no Natsu"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30a4\u30ea\u30e4\u306e\u7a7a\u3001UFO\u306e\u590f"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Sky of Iriya, Summer of UFO"}], "title": "Iriya no Sora, UFO no Natsu", "title_english": "Sky of Iriya, Summer of UFO", "title_japanese": "\u30a4\u30ea\u30e4\u306e\u7a7a\u3001UFO\u306e\u590f", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "OVA", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 6, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2005-02-25T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2005-06-29T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 25, "month": 2, "year": 2005}, "to": {"day": 29, "month": 6, "year": 2005}}, "string": "Feb 25, 2005 to Jun 29, 2005"}, "duration": "27 min per ep", "rating": "R+ - Mild Nudity", "score": 6.89, "scored_by": 11485, "rank": 5012, "popularity": 4712, "members": 27096, "favorites": 70, "synopsis": "Asaba Naoyuki is an ordinary high school student.

Nuku Nuku's classmates are all eccentrics, Futaba, the class president, is a domineering control-freak, who cannot leave her authority in school. Chieko Shirakaba is the rich snob with the two yes-girls who always take her side. There is a bookworm, a mystic, a scientist, and a pop singer. All of these are true to their descriptions: the mystic is always foretelling doom via tarot cards, spirits, or some other occult technique. The pop singer never says anything except as a song. The bookworm always has her nose in a book. These eccentricities add to the series' humor. \n\n(Source: ANN)", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 1998, "broadcast": {"day": "Wednesdays", "time": "18:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 18:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 127, "type": "anime", "name": "Yomiko Advertising", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/127/Yomiko_Advertising"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 97, "type": "anime", "name": "ADV Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}, {"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Discotek Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 242, "type": "anime", "name": "Ashi Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/242/Ashi_Productions"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}, {"mal_id": 376, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/376/Elfen_Lied__Tooriame_nite_Arui_wa_Shoujo_wa_Ikani_Shite_Sono_Shinjou_ni_Itatta_ka_-_Regenschauer", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1936/121639.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1936/121639t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1936/121639l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1936/121639.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1936/121639t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1936/121639l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Elfen Lied: Tooriame nite Arui wa, Shoujo wa Ikani Shite Sono Shinjou ni Itatta ka? - Regenschauer"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Elfen Lied Special"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Elfen Lied OVA"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30a8\u30eb\u30d5\u30a7\u30f3\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8 \u901a\u308a\u96e8\u306b\u3066 \u6216\u3044\u306f\u3001\u5c11\u5973\u306f\u3044\u304b\u306b\u3057\u3066\u305d\u306e\u5fc3\u60c5\u306b\u81f3\u3063\u305f\u304b?\uff08REGENSCHAUER\uff09"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Elfen Lied: In the Passing Rain, or, How Can a Girl Have Reached Such Feelings?"}], "title": "Elfen Lied: Tooriame nite Arui wa, Shoujo wa Ikani Shite Sono Shinjou ni Itatta ka? - Regenschauer", "title_english": "Elfen Lied: In the Passing Rain, or, How Can a Girl Have Reached Such Feelings?", "title_japanese": "\u30a8\u30eb\u30d5\u30a7\u30f3\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8 \u901a\u308a\u96e8\u306b\u3066 \u6216\u3044\u306f\u3001\u5c11\u5973\u306f\u3044\u304b\u306b\u3057\u3066\u305d\u306e\u5fc3\u60c5\u306b\u81f3\u3063\u305f\u304b?\uff08REGENSCHAUER\uff09", "title_synonyms": ["Elfen Lied Special", "Elfen Lied OVA"], "type": "Special", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2005-04-21T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 21, "month": 4, "year": 2005}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Apr 21, 2005"}, "duration": "25 min", "rating": "R+ - Mild Nudity", "score": 7.12, "scored_by": 117658, "rank": 3907, "popularity": 1330, "members": 201003, "favorites": 270, "synopsis": "Having been accepted into the Kaede Inn, Nana struggles to find some way to contribute, though she inadvertently brings more trouble than assistance.

However, humans have come to forget and jest at the existence of demons, and no longer understand the privilege it is to live without fear.

They live in the world of the demons. It is now up to Otoha to prove himself as a Karas, and restore the balance that Eko threatens to upset.\n\nMeanwhile, a superstitious police officer named Sagisaka and his rational new recruit, Kure, follow the trail of the murders dealt by Eko's Mikura, as well as the trail of a rogue Mikura named Nue.

The only characteristic he has to go by is that the murderer has a claw for an arm, hence the murderer being referred to as The Claw Man. During his travels, Van happens to pass through the city of Evergreen, which is defending itself from bandits who aim to rob the city of its treasury. It is in this city that Van meets Wendy Garret, a timid young girl who is looking for her kidnapped brother. When the city pleads for Van's assistance to defend it, he refuses, claiming it has nothing to do with him and thus leaves the city on its own to deal with the peril. Soon after, Van comes across the raiding bandits himself and they eventually tick off the swordsman to a degree where he takes action against them for his own personal vendetta.

The latter was originally broadcasted at the Japanese radio show \"Anime Scramble,\" on December 10 and December 17, 2004.

Thus, in every country they visit, there is always something to learn from the way people carry out their lives. \n\nIt is not up to Kino or Hermes to decide whether these asserted values are wrong or right, as they merely assume the roles of observers within this small world. They do not attempt to change or influence the places they visit, despite how absurd these values would appear. That's because in one way or another, they believe things are fine as they are, and that \"the world is not beautiful; therefore, it is.\"\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2003, "broadcast": {"day": "Tuesdays", "time": "18:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Tuesdays at 18:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 33, "type": "anime", "name": "WOWOW", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/33/WOWOW"}, {"mal_id": 79, "type": "anime", "name": "Genco", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/79/Genco"}, {"mal_id": 144, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"}, {"mal_id": 412, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Wombat", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/412/Studio_Wombat"}, {"mal_id": 665, "type": "anime", "name": "chara-ani.com", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/665/chara-anicom"}, {"mal_id": 681, "type": "anime", "name": "ASCII Media Works", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/681/ASCII_Media_Works"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 97, "type": "anime", "name": "ADV Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}, {"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 179, "type": "anime", "name": "A.C.G.T.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/179/ACGT"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 487, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/487/Girls_Bravo__Second_Season", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1538/133872.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1538/133872t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1538/133872l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1538/133872.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1538/133872t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1538/133872l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Girls Bravo: Second Season"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "GIRLS\u30d6\u30e9\u30dc\u30fc second season"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Girls Bravo: Second Season"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Girls Bravo Temporada 2"}], "title": "Girls Bravo: Second Season", "title_english": "Girls Bravo: Second Season", "title_japanese": "GIRLS\u30d6\u30e9\u30dc\u30fc second season", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2005-01-27T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2005-04-21T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 27, "month": 1, "year": 2005}, "to": {"day": 21, "month": 4, "year": 2005}}, "string": "Jan 27, 2005 to Apr 21, 2005"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "R+ - Mild Nudity", "score": 6.59, "scored_by": 50280, "rank": 6761, "popularity": 2377, "members": 95912, "favorites": 139, "synopsis": "Small for his age, Yukinari has been bullied and abused by girls all his life.

If they don't manage to break Shuichi out of his slump soon, it could mean the end of Bad Luck for good! \n\n(Source: RightStuf)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 155, "type": "anime", "name": "animate Film", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/155/animate_Film"}, {"mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 217, "type": "anime", "name": "Nozomi Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/217/Nozomi_Entertainment"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 107, "type": "anime", "name": "Plum", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/107/Plum"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 28, "type": "anime", "name": "Boys Love", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/28/Boys_Love"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}, {"mal_id": 19, "type": "anime", "name": "Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}, {"mal_id": 75, "type": "anime", "name": "Showbiz", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/75/Showbiz"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 25, "type": "anime", "name": "Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]}, {"mal_id": 508, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/508/Tottoko_Hamtarou", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/21562.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/21562t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/21562l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/21562.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/21562t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/21562l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Tottoko Hamtarou"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Tottoko Hamtaro Dechu"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Tottoko Hamutaro"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u3068\u3063\u3068\u3053\u30cf\u30e0\u592a\u90ce"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Hamtaro"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Hamtaro"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Hamtaro"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Hamtaro"}], "title": "Tottoko Hamtarou", "title_english": "Hamtaro", "title_japanese": "\u3068\u3063\u3068\u3053\u30cf\u30e0\u592a\u90ce", "title_synonyms": ["Tottoko Hamtaro Dechu", "Tottoko Hamutaro"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 296, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2000-07-07T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2006-03-31T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 7, "month": 7, "year": 2000}, "to": {"day": 31, "month": 3, "year": 2006}}, "string": "Jul 7, 2000 to Mar 31, 2006"}, "duration": "25 min per ep", "rating": "G - All Ages", "score": 7.02, "scored_by": 31032, "rank": 4446, "popularity": 3015, "members": 63965, "favorites": 294, "synopsis": "He's small, fluffy, and absolutely adorable: Hamtarou is one perfect little hamster!

The city uses the very pollution that caused the disaster as an energy source.\n\nHowever, although the initial plan was successful to an extent, it didn't just create a new source of energy, but also an elite group of people.

He leads a very difficult life, but tries to make the most of it through the love that he feels for his childhood friend Jay. Unfortunately, Jay may be more interested in her security commander Cade than in Shua, and thus a love triangle is formed.

It remains populated by forgotten pasts and the ruins of their labors due to a calamity 40 years ago.

Acting as a professional negotiator and suave agent, Roger is a self-tailored ladies man whose only love is for funeral black. However, as he gets deeply involved with his clients, what often starts as a simple negotiation evolves into Roger saving Paradigm from crime and peril.\n\nIn the process, Roger stumbles even deeper into the untold folds of the city. As a rule, things are hardly ever as they appear. Serving as gray knight in a gray world, Roger is not without allies. By his side are Norman, a loyal and widely skilled butler, and Dorothy, a human-like android with deadpan snark. Together with the relic Big O, a jet-black mecha of gargantuan size and weight, they help Roger serve iron justice to Paradigm's lurking villains as he discovers the truth about 40 years ago.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 1999, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Visual", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 233, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/233/Bandai_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Sunrise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}, {"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}, {"mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 568, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/568/Bubblegum_Crisis_Tokyo_2040", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1699/92414.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1699/92414t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1699/92414l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1699/92414.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1699/92414t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1699/92414l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "dGxTRcswhXs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGxTRcswhXs", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/dGxTRcswhXs?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dGxTRcswhXs/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dGxTRcswhXs/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dGxTRcswhXs/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dGxTRcswhXs/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dGxTRcswhXs/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Bubblegum Crisis 2040"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30ac\u30e0\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30b7\u30b9 TOKYO2040"}], "title": "Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30ac\u30e0\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30b7\u30b9 TOKYO2040", "title_synonyms": ["Bubblegum Crisis 2040"], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 26, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "1998-10-08T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "1999-04-01T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 8, "month": 10, "year": 1998}, "to": {"day": 1, "month": 4, "year": 1999}}, "string": "Oct 8, 1998 to Apr 1, 1999"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 7.08, "scored_by": 15895, "rank": 4154, "popularity": 3773, "members": 43005, "favorites": 210, "synopsis": "In the wake of an earthquake that devastated most of the city, Tokyo has been rebuilt in record time due to the development of humanoid robots known as boomers.

Random breakdowns in their neural structure are causing some of them to go berserk, destroying property and killing humans in violent rampages. To combat this, Tokyo has formed the Advanced Police, a peacekeeping force with jurisdiction over boomer matters. There are also rumors of a second group known as the Knight Sabers, a vigilante unit operating from the shadows.\n\nTrying to investigate the Knight Sabers, the adventurous Linna Yamazaki travels to Tokyo in pursuit of her heroes. There, she finds the enigmatic singer Priscilla Asagiri, the beautiful entrepreneur Sylia Stingray, and the exuberant Nene Romanova, each with their own reasons for coming together.

Haru's inability to properly communicate with the cats leads to the misunderstanding that she has accepted the proposal.\n\nAs Haru ponders on ways to escape the predicament, a mysterious voice instructs her to search for the Cat Bureau. However, not long after she finally arrives at the bureau, a horde of cats swarms in and forcibly takes her to the Cat Kingdom, along with a member of the Cat Bureau. Concerned for their safety, owner of the Cat Bureau, Baron Humbert von Gikkingen, follows close behind.\n\nThe more Haru immerses herself in the activities of the Cat Kingdom, the more cat-like she becomes. To her dismay, she soon learns that, unless she can find her true self, she may become a cat permanently. Haru's adventures in the world of cats lead her down a path to self-discovery, allowing her to return as a more confident person.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "The Cat Returns is a spin-off of the movie Whisper of the Heart, and although some characters are crossed over, the stories in the two films are not related.

On the moon, the elite of magic and science has been gathered and the \"Magic Town Sorcerium\" built. Day by day, research is done and big wealth awarded to human race. However, this prosperity also brings with it a fight for those interests and leads finally to the \"Big Magic War\" between earth and moon, which causes the downfall of glory.\n\nThe few surviving humans start to rebuild a new civilization. But forbidden arms (DNA -attackers and -changers) that were used in the big magic war left deep scars and several obscurities like giant creatures and others threaten the humans, being weak having lost all magic and science. Scared as they are, all they wish for is that this terror comes to an end. However, there is someone contrary to those terrors - \"Heaven\" sent \"Angels\", girls with special powers who are sent to various points in history to put things right. This thrilling story describes how the fighting girls protect humanity from terror. But despite the existence of them, the deep darkness is spreading.\n\nLasty Farson, code name Angel Rabbie, is our clumsy and ever-hungry heroine. On her first day, she's late but when trouble strikes, she's sent from the station down to the planet and helps a group of villagers clear out a woman and her gang stealing food and treasure from the people. At the same time, she learns Lukia Shawl, a missing comrade it seems is somehow involved or at least up to something of her own (she'd been missing so long, she was presumed dead).\n\n(Source: The Smuggler)", "background": "Characters are based on the Visual Novel, Angelic Serenade.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "AIC", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"}, {"mal_id": 108, "type": "anime", "name": "Media Factory", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/108/Media_Factory"}, {"mal_id": 741, "type": "anime", "name": "Toshiba Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/741/Toshiba_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 2981, "type": "anime", "name": "Omnibus Promotion", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2981/Omnibus_Promotion"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 83, "type": "anime", "name": "AIC Spirits", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/83/AIC_Spirits"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 682, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/682/Otogi_Story_Tenshi_no_Shippo", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/21092.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/21092t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/21092l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/21092.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/21092t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/21092l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "hO07K8Kafus", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hO07K8Kafus", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/hO07K8Kafus?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/hO07K8Kafus/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/hO07K8Kafus/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/hO07K8Kafus/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/hO07K8Kafus/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/hO07K8Kafus/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Otogi Story Tenshi no Shippo"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Angel's Tail"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Fairy Tale Angel Tail"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Angel Tails"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u304a\u3068\u304e\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u3000\u5929\u4f7f\u306e\u3057\u3063\u307d"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Angel Tales"}], "title": "Otogi Story Tenshi no Shippo", "title_english": "Angel Tales", "title_japanese": "\u304a\u3068\u304e\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u3000\u5929\u4f7f\u306e\u3057\u3063\u307d", "title_synonyms": ["Angel's Tail", "Fairy Tale Angel Tail", "Angel Tails"], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2001-10-04T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2001-12-20T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 4, "month": 10, "year": 2001}, "to": {"day": 20, "month": 12, "year": 2001}}, "string": "Oct 4, 2001 to Dec 20, 2001"}, "duration": "22 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.49, "scored_by": 6535, "rank": 7380, "popularity": 5704, "members": 16729, "favorites": 26, "synopsis": "Goro's down on his luck.

When Masaya is attacked by a monster, she discovers that she is able to transform into the cat-eared magical girl, Mew Ichigo.\n \nAfter she saves Masaya, two researchers named Ryou Shirogane and Keiichiro Akasaka approach her and reveal they had injected her with Iriomote Cat DNA in order to create a magical girl that can save the world from aliens.

This includes the delicate Princess Aeka of Jurai and her playful younger sister Princess Sasami; the scatterbrained first-class detective Mihoshi Kuramitsu and her more capable partner Kiyone Makibi; and the eccentric, mad scientist Washuu Hakubi.\n\nThe six women do their best to adapt to their new lives, but their more advanced and exotic lifestyle does not mesh well with the simplistic customs on Earth. As a result, they just end up making a mess and causing trouble for poor Tenchi. Though the girls are a pain, Tenchi begins to form a close relationship with each of them, and through their bond, he begins to gain a better understanding of his role in the universe.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 1995, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "18:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 18:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 204, "type": "anime", "name": "Pioneer LDC", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/204/Pioneer_LDC"}, {"mal_id": 3172, "type": "anime", "name": "Arts Pro", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3172/Arts_Pro"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}, {"mal_id": 1459, "type": "anime", "name": "Geneon Entertainment USA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "AIC", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}, {"mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "Space", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 704, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/704/Kanon_Kazahana", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1716/132253.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1716/132253t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1716/132253l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1716/132253.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1716/132253t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1716/132253l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Kanon Kazahana"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Kanon Wind Flower"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30ab\u30ce\u30f3 \u98a8\u82b1"}], "title": "Kanon Kazahana", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u30ab\u30ce\u30f3 \u98a8\u82b1", "title_synonyms": ["Kanon Wind Flower"], "type": "Special", "source": "Visual novel", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2003-05-03T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 3, "month": 5, "year": 2003}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "May 3, 2003"}, "duration": "20 min", "rating": "G - All Ages", "score": 6.68, "scored_by": 6439, "rank": 6179, "popularity": 6001, "members": 14587, "favorites": 4, "synopsis": "The spring has come since Yuuichi reunited with Ayu, and lives of all major characters are back on track.

Struggling to balance his friendship with Matsuno and his own budding infatuation for Rikako, Taku must come to terms with his feelings and understand how a girl with a troubled past is having such a massive effect on his life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 382, "type": "anime", "name": "Tokuma Shoten", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/382/Tokuma_Shoten"}, {"mal_id": 1003, "type": "anime", "name": "Nippon Television Network", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1003/Nippon_Television_Network"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 783, "type": "anime", "name": "GKIDS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/783/GKIDS"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 21, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Ghibli", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/21/Studio_Ghibli"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 64, "type": "anime", "name": "Love Polygon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/64/Love_Polygon"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 744, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/744/Trouble_Chocolate", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/61293.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/61293t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/61293l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/61293.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/61293t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/61293l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Trouble Chocolate"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8"}], "title": "Trouble Chocolate", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Radio", "episodes": 20, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "1999-10-08T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2000-03-24T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 8, "month": 10, "year": 1999}, "to": {"day": 24, "month": 3, "year": 2000}}, "string": "Oct 8, 1999 to Mar 24, 2000"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.48, "scored_by": 2441, "rank": 7405, "popularity": 8203, "members": 6780, "favorites": 23, "synopsis": "Cacao, a student at Micro Grand Academy, wakes up one morning to find a girl made of wood sleeping in bed with him.

After visiting her boyfriend's final resting place, she declares herself Munsu's bodyguard and, together, they set out on a mission to punish those who stripped Jushin of its original glory. \n\n(Source: AniDB)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 3087, "type": "anime", "name": "Shogakukan Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3087/Shogakukan_Productions"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 97, "type": "anime", "name": "ADV Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}, {"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1231, "type": "anime", "name": "OLM Digital", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1231/OLM_Digital"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 885, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/885/Tenshi_no_Tamago", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1034/135640.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1034/135640t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1034/135640l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1034/135640.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1034/135640t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1034/135640l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "j3qMwnMtnhQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qMwnMtnhQ", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/j3qMwnMtnhQ?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/j3qMwnMtnhQ/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/j3qMwnMtnhQ/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/j3qMwnMtnhQ/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/j3qMwnMtnhQ/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/j3qMwnMtnhQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Tenshi no Tamago"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u5929\u4f7f\u306e\u305f\u307e\u3054"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Angel's Egg"}], "title": "Tenshi no Tamago", "title_english": "Angel's Egg", "title_japanese": "\u5929\u4f7f\u306e\u305f\u307e\u3054", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "OVA", "source": "Original", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "1985-12-22T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 22, "month": 12, "year": 1985}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Dec 22, 1985"}, "duration": "1 hr 11 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.71, "scored_by": 66680, "rank": 1324, "popularity": 1542, "members": 172375, "favorites": 3833, "synopsis": "The surrealist world of Tenshi no Tamago is desolate and devoid of the bustle of traditional everyday life.
